and includes a definition of emplace and other experimental combinations.

{-| makeChoices is a temporary tool which does not attempt to analyse choices for correctness.
It can thus create some choices which will be incorrect.
The unknowns returned from classifyDartWings can become largeKiteCentres or largeDartBases.
This produces 2^n choices where n is the number of unknowns (excluding lone dart wing tips with valencyD 2).
