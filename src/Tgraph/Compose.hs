Description : A compose operation for Tgraphs

Stability   : experimental

This module includes the main composition operations compose, partCompose,
tryPartCompose and the more efficient versions composeF, partComposeF (for explicitly forced Tgraphs).
It also exposes 
auxiliary functions
tryGetDartWingInfo, getDartWingInfoForced (and type DartWingInfo)
and partComposeFacesFrom for debugging.
